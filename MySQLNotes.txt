# What is an RDBMS ?
    -> MySQL is an RDBMS. Think of a Database as a digital filing cabinet
    -> Inside that cabinet, you have folders
    -> In SQL, those folders are "Tables"

    -> The Table: This is where data lives. It is a grid structure containing data about one specific subject: Users, Products, Orders
    -> The Column: These are the vertical headers. They define "what kind of data" creates a record: FirstName, Age, Email
    -> The Row: These are the horizontal lines. A row represent "one single item"
    -> The Primary Key: Every row needs a unique fingerprint to distinguish it from others

    -> Real World Example: E-Commerce App
        -> Imagine we are building the database for a site like Amazon or Trendyol
        -> We need a table to store our Customers

        -> Table Name: "Customers"
            ->  customer_id (PK)    |   full_name   |   email   |   country

> Code Practice

    -> Create database and use that database in mysql workbench
        > CREATE DATABASE sql_course;
        > USE sql_course;

    -> Create the Table Structure
        > CREATE TABLE Users (
            user_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
            username VARCHAR(50),
            email VARCHAR(100),
            age INT
        );

    -> Insert Data
        > INSERT INTO Users (username, email, age) VALUES ('JohnDoe', 'john@test.com', 28);
        > INSERT INTO Users (username, email, age) VALUES ('TechGuru', 'techguru@test.com', 32);
        > INSERT INTO Users (username, email, age) VALUES ('VedatCinbat', 'vedat@test.com', 24);

    -> Verify
        > SELECT * FROM Users;
